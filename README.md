# system_face-recognition
This is the system finds a similarity image. In the current version, we were able to find k-similar images in the 70000 image data set with a time of 0.5s / image. With 70k images, We use about 3MB of RAM and run on Intel Core i7-2620M CPU 2.70 GHz. Supported systems run on ubuntu, macOS, windows. In the future, We will develop it more effective. 

Easy install:

We assume you had python3.x.x

First step:
	Install Django with the command line in the terminal or similar tool
	pip install Django
Second:
	Running project:
	You must cd to folder report/app and run  command :
	python manage.py runserver 
	After that, you visit the following link:
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload
	notice:
	In Django default port is 8000 but you can change it and You can reference in website: https://www.djangoproject.com/

In this project, We use API MMLAB UIT get feature extraction VGG and algorithm VP-Tree.
Database:
	+ Because the GitHub limit only allows projects <100MB, so we use a portion of data in the future, we will upload more data.
	+ We put data in folder report/app/home/data, and We put features extractions in the report/app/home/VGG_feature.

Algorithm Vp-Tree:
	process_Tree.py
Process request in file ( get request and call vp-tree):
	process_request.py
Front end:
	Boostrap

In the future, we will develop features that make admin easy to configure and you can continue to develop it.

Thank you for your interest in this project <3
